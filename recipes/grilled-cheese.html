        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices white bread</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter 
                one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in 
                the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice 
                of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue 
                cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices 
                of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.
